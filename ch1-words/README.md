# Words 
## Define new or unfamiliar terms
+ If the term already exists, link to a good existing explanation. (Don't reinvent the wheel.)
+ If your document is introducing the term, define the term. If your document is introducing many terms, collect the definitions into a glossary.

## Use terms consistently
+ Once you've named a component thingy, don't rename it thingamabob.
+ when introducing a long-winded concept name or product name, you may also specify a shortened version of that name. 

## Use acronyms properly
+ On the initial use of an unfamiliar acronym within a document or a section, spell out the full term, and then put the acronym in parentheses. **bold face**
+ Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
+ Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
    -  The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
    - The acronym appears many times in the document.
    
## Disambiguate pronouns
     In many cases, you should simply avoid the pronoun and just reuse the noun.
+ Only use a pronoun after you've introduced the noun; never use the pronoun before you've introduced the noun.
+ if more than five words separate your noun from your pronoun, consider repeating the noun instead of using the pronoun.
+ If you introduce a second noun between your noun and your pronoun, reuse your noun instead of using a pronoun.

**Exercise
    Identify all possible meanings for the ambiguous pronouns in each of the following passages:**

* Aparna and Phil share responsibilities with Maysam and Karan and they are the next ones on call.

* You may import Carambola data via your configuration file or dynamically at run time. This may be a security risk.
