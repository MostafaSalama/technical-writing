# Words 
## Define new or unfamiliar terms
+ If the term already exists, link to a good existing explanation. (Don't reinvent the wheel.)
+ If your document is introducing the term, define the term. If your document is introducing many terms, collect the definitions into a glossary.

## Use terms consistently
+ Once you've named a component thingy, don't rename it thingamabob.
+ when introducing a long-winded concept name or product name, you may also specify a shortened version of that name.
